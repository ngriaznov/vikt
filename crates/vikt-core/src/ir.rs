//! The language-neutral IR contract.
//!
//! This is the seam that makes the analysis multi-language. A frontend lowers
//! whatever substrate it has — JVM bytecode, CPython bytecode, LLVM IR, MIR —
//! into [`FunctionIr`] and gets tiering, scoring and line projection for free.
//!
//! The contract is deliberately small. A frontend must answer four questions
//! per instruction: what line did it come from, what does it define, what does
//! it use, and where can control go next. Everything else the core derives.
//!
//! Two properties are load-bearing:
//!
//! - **The graph is instruction-level, not block-level.** Frontends do not have
//!   to discover basic blocks; every substrate we care about already exposes a
//!   per-instruction successor relation.
//! - **Definitions need not be in SSA form.** The core computes reaching
//!   definitions itself, so a frontend over non-SSA locals (CPython's
//!   `STORE_FAST`) is exactly as correct as one over an SSA IR (mokapot's
//!   MokaIR). Frontends report facts; they do not do dataflow.
