//! The sidecar artifact: line ranges to tier, with a reason for each.
//!
//! This is the whole deliverable. Everything upstream exists to produce it, and
//! every consumer (an agent reading a file, a harness hook gating an edit, a
//! profiler picking a starting point, a dependency graph weighting its
//! nodes) reads this and nothing else.
//!
//! Two design commitments show up in the schema:
//!
//! - **Nothing is removed.** The artifact is metadata *about* source, never a
//!   rewritten copy of it. A consumer that ignores the sidecar sees exactly the
//!   file it would have seen anyway.
//! - **Every span carries its reason.** A tier a consumer cannot interrogate is
//!   a number to be trusted on faith, which is precisely what an inference-free
//!   analysis exists to avoid.
